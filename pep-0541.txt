Abstract
========

This PEP proposes an extension to the Terms of Use [1]_ of the Package
Index [2]_, clarifying expectations of package owners regarding
ownership of a package name on the Package Index, specifically with
regards to conflict resolution.

Existing package repositories such as CPAN [3]_, NPM [4]_, and
GitHub [5]_ will be investigated as prior art in this field.


Rationale
=========

Given that package names on the Index are sharing a single flat
namespace, a unique name is a finite resource.


Specification
=============

TBD.


Implementation
==============

TBD.


Rejected Proposals
==================

The original approach was to hope for the best and solve issues as they
arise without written policy.  This is not sustainable.  The lack of
generally available guidelines in writing on package name conflict
resolution is causing unnecessary tensions.  From the perspective of
users, decisions made by the Package Index maintainers without written
guidelines may appear arbitrary.  From the perspective of the Package
Index maintainers, solving name conflicts is a stressful task due to
risk of unintentional harm due to lack of defined policy.

TBD.
