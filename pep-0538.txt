Abstract
========

An ongoing challenge with Python 3 on \*nix systems is the conflict between
needing to use the configured locale encoding by default for consistency with
other C/C++ components in the same process, and the fact that the standard C
locale (as defined in POSIX:2001) specifies a default encoding of ASCII, which
is entirely inappropriate for the development of networked services in a
multilingual world.

This PEP proposes that the CPython implementation be changed such that:

* when used as a library, ``Py_Initialize`` will warn that use of the legacy
  ``C`` locale may cause various Unicode compatibility issues
* when used as a standalone binary, CPython will automatically coerce the
  ``C`` locale to ``C.UTF-8`` unless the new ``PYTHONALLOWCLOCALE`` environment
  variable is set

With this change, any \*nix platform that does *not* offer the ``C.UTF-8``
locale as part of its standard configuration will only be considered a
fully supported platform for CPython 3.7+ deployments when a non-ASCII locale
is set explicitly.

Redistributors (such as Linux distributions) with a narrower target audience
may also choose to opt in to this behaviour for earlier Python 3.x releases by
applying the necessary changes as a downstream patch to those versions.


Background
==========

While the CPython interpreter is starting up, it may need to convert from
the ``char *`` format to the ``wchar_t *`` format, or from one of those formats
to ``PyUnicodeObject *``, before its own text encoding handling machinery is
fully configured. It handles these cases by relying on the operating system to
do the conversion and then ensuring that the text encoding name reported by
``sys.getfilesystemencoding()`` matches the encoding used during this early
bootstrapping process.

On Mac OS X, this is straightforward, as Apple guarantees that these operations
will always use UTF-8 to do the conversion.

On Windows, the limitations of the ``mbcs`` format used by default in these
conversions proved sufficiently problematic that PEP 528 and PEP 529 were
implemented to bypass the operating system supplied interfaces for binary data
handling and force the use of UTF-8 instead.

On non-Apple \*nix systems however, these operations are handled using the C
locale system, which has the following characteristics [4_]:

* by default, all processes start in the ``C`` locale, which uses ``ASCII``
  for these conversions. This is almost never what anyone doing multilingual
  text processing actually wants (including CPython)
* calling ``setlocale(LC_ALL, "")`` reconfigures the active locale based on
  the locale categories configured in the current process environment
* if the locale requested by the current environment is unknown, or no specific
  locale is configured, then the default ``C`` locale will remain active

The specific locale category that covers the APIs that CPython depends on is
``LC_CTYPE``, which applies to "classification and conversion of characters,
and to multibyte and wide characters" [5_]. Accordingly, CPython includes the
following key calls to ``setlocale``:

* in ``Py_Initialize``, CPython calls ``setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "")``, such that
  the configured locale settings for that category *always* match those set in
  the environment. It does this unconditionally, and it *doesn't* revert the
  process state change in ``Py_Finalize``
* in the main ``python`` binary, CPython calls ``setlocale(LC_ALL, "")`` to
  configure the entire C locale subsystem according to the process environment.
  It does this prior to making any calls into the shared CPython library

These calls are usually sufficient to provide sensible behaviour, but they can
still fail in the following cases:

* SSH environment forwarding means that SSH clients will often forward
  client locale settings to servers that don't have that locale installed
* some process environments (such as Linux containers) may not have any
  explicit locale configured at all


Proposal
========

To better handle the cases where CPython would otherwise end up attempting
to operate in the ``C`` locale, this PEP proposes changes to CPython's
behaviour both when it is run as a standalone command line application, as well
as when it is used as a shared library to embed a Python runtime as part of a
larger application.

When ``Py_Initialize`` is called and CPython detects that the configured locale
is the default ``C`` locale, the following warning will be issued::

   Py_Initialize detected LC_CTYPE=C, which limits Unicode compatibility. Some
   libraries and operating system interfaces may not work correctly. Set
   `PYTHONALLOWCLOCALE=1 LC_CTYPE=C` to configure a similar environment
   when running Python directly.

This warning informs both system and application integrators that they're
running Python 3 in a configuration that we don't expect to work properly.

By contrast, when CPython *is* the main application, it will instead
automatically coerce the legacy C locale to the multilingual C.UTF-8 locale::

    Python detected LC_CTYPE=C, forcing LC_ALL & LANG to C.UTF-8 (set
    PYTHONALLOWCLOCALE to disable this locale coercion behaviour).

This locale coercion will mean that the standard Python binary should once
again "just work" in the two main failure cases we're aware of (missing locale
settings and SSH forwarding of unknown locales), as long as the target
platform provides the ``C.UTF-8`` locale.

This coercion will be implemented by actually setting the ``LANG`` and
``LC_ALL`` environment variables to ``C.UTF-8``, such that future calls to
``setlocale()`` will see them, as will other components looking for those
settings (such as GUI development frameworks).

The locale coercion will be skipped if the ``PYTHONALLOWCLOCALE`` environment
variable is set to a non-empty string. The interpreter will always check for
the ``PYTHONALLOWCLOCALE`` environment variable (even when running under the
``-E`` or ``-I`` switches), as the locale coercion check necessarily takes
place before any command line argument processing.


Platform Support Changes
========================

A new "Legacy C Locale" section will be added to PEP 11 that states:

* as of Python 3.7, the legacy C locale is no longer officially supported,
  and any Unicode handling issues that occur only in that locale and cannot be
  reproduced in an appropriately configured non-ASCII locale will be closed as
  "won't fix"
* as of Python 3.7, \*nix platforms are expected to provide the ``C.UTF-8``
  locale as an alternative to the legacy ``C`` locale. On platforms which don't
  yet provide that locale, an explicit non-ASCII locale setting will be needed
  to configure a supported environment for running Python 3.7+


Rationale
=========


Improving the handling of the C locale
--------------------------------------

It has been clear for some time that the C locale's default encoding of
``ASCII`` is entirely the wrong choice for development of modern networked
services. Newer languages like Rust and Go have eschewed that default entirely,
and instead made it a deployment requirement that systems be configured to use
UTF-8 as the text encoding for operating system interfaces. Similarly, Node.js
assumes UTF-8 by default (a behaviour inherited from the V8 JavaScript engine)
and requires custom build settings to indicate it should use the system
locale settings for locale-aware operations. Both the JVM and the .NET CLR
use UTF-16-LE as their primary encoding for passing text between applications
and the underlying platform.

The challenge for CPython has been the fact that in addition to being used for
network service development, it is also extensively used as an embedded
scripting language in larger applications, and as a desktop application
development language, where it is more important to be consistent with other
C/C++ components sharing the same process, as well as with the user's desktop
locale settings, than it is with the emergent conventions of modern network
service development.

The premise of this PEP is that for *all* of these use cases, the default "C"
locale is wrong, and furthermore that the following assumptions are valid:

* in desktop application use cases, the process locale will *already* be
  configured appropriately, and if it isn't, then that is an operating system
  level problem that needs to be reported to and resolved by the operating
  system provider
* in network service development use cases (especially those based on Linux
  containers), the process locale may not be configured *at all*, and if it
  isn't, then the expectation is that components will impose their own default
  encoding the way Rust, Go and Node.js do, rather than trusting the legacy C
  default encoding of ASCII the way CPython currently does


Dropping official support for Unicode handling in the legacy C locale
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We've been trying to get strict bytes/text separation to work reliably in the
legacy C locale for over a decade at this point. Not only haven't we been able
to get it to work, neither has anyone else - the only viable alternatives
identified have been to pass the bytes along verbatim without eagerly decoding
them to text (Python 2.x, Ruby, etc), or else to ignore the nominal C/C++ locale
encoding entirely and assume the use of either UTF-8 (Rust, Go, Node.js, etc)
or UTF-16-LE (JVM, .NET CLR).

While this PEP ensures that developers that need to do so can still opt-in to
running their Python code in the legacy C locale, it also makes clear that we
*don't* expect Python 3's Unicode handling to be reliable in that configuration,
and the recommended alternative is to use a more appropriate locale setting.


Providing implicit locale coercion only when running standalone
---------------------------------------------------------------

Over the course of Python 3.x development, multiple attempts have been made
to improve the handling of incorrect locale settings at the point where the
Python interpreter is initialised. The problem that emerged is that this is
ultimately *too late* in the interpreter startup process - data such as command
line arguments and the contents of environment variables may have already been
retrieved from the operating system and processed under the incorrect ASCII
text encoding assumption well before ``Py_Initialize`` is called.

The problems created by those inconsistencies were then even harder to diagnose
and debug than those created by believing the operating system's claim that
ASCII was a suitable encoding to use for operating system interfaces. This was
the case even for the default CPython binary, let alone larger C/C++
applications that embed CPython as a scripting engine.

The approach proposed in this PEP handles that problem by moving the locale
coercion as early as possible in the interpreter startup sequence when running
standalone: it takes place directly in the C-level ``main()`` function, even
before calling in to the `Py_Main()`` library function that implements the
features of the CPython interpreter CLI.

The ``Py_Initialize`` API then only gains an explicit warning (emitted on
``stderr``) when it detects use of the ``C`` locale, and relies on the
embedding application to specify something more reasonable.


Querying LC_CTYPE for C locale detection
----------------------------------------

``LC_CTYPE`` is the actual locale category that CPython relies on to drive the
implicit decoding of environment variables, command line arguments, and other
text values received from the operating system.

As such, it makes sense to check it specifically when attempting to determine
whether or not the current locale configuration is likely to cause Unicode
handling problems.


Setting both LANG & LC_ALL for C.UTF-8 locale coercion
------------------------------------------------------

Python is often used as a glue language, integrating other C/C++ ABI compatible
components in the current process, and components written in arbitrary
languages in subprocesses.

Setting ``LC_ALL`` to ``C.UTF-8`` imposes a locale setting override on all
C/C++ components in the current process and in any subprocesses that inherit
the current environment.

Setting ``LANG`` to ``C.UTF-8`` ensures that even components that only check
the ``LANG`` fallback for their locale settings will still use ``C.UTF-8``.

Together, these should ensure that when the locale coercion is activated, the
switch to the C.UTF-8 locale will be applied consistently across the current
process and any subprocesses that inherit the current environment.


Allowing restoration of the legacy behaviour
--------------------------------------------

The CPython command line interpreter is often used to investigate faults that
occur in other applications that embed CPython, and those applications may still
be using the C locale even after this PEP is implemented.

Providing a simple on/off switch for the locale coercion behaviour makes it
much easier to reproduce the behaviour of such applications for debugging
purposes, as well as making it easier to reproduce the behaviour of older 3.x
runtimes even when running a version with this change applied.


Implementation
==============

A draft implementation of the change (including test cases) has been
posted to issue 28180 [1_], which is an end user request that
``sys.getfilesystemencoding()`` default to ``utf-8`` rather than ``ascii``.


Backporting to earlier Python 3 releases
========================================

If this PEP is accepted for Python 3.7, backporting of the change to earlier
Python 3 releases by redistributors will be both allowed and encouraged.
However, to serve any useful purpose, such backports should only be undertaken
either in conjunction with the changes needed to also provide the C.UTF-8
locale by default, or else specifically for platforms where that locale is
already consistently available.


Acknowledgements
================

The locale coercion approach proposed in this PEP is inspired directly by
Armin Ronacher's handling of this problem in the ``click`` command line
utility development framework [2_]::

    $ LANG=C python3 -c 'import click; cli = click.command()(lambda:None); cli()'
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    RuntimeError: Click will abort further execution because Python 3 was
    configured to use ASCII as encoding for the environment.  Either run this
    under Python 2 or consult http://click.pocoo.org/python3/ for mitigation
    steps.

    This system supports the C.UTF-8 locale which is recommended.
    You might be able to resolve your issue by exporting the
    following environment variables:

        export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8
        export LANG=C.UTF-8

The change was originally proposed as a downstream patch for Fedora's
system Python 3.6 package [3_], and then reformulated as a PEP for Python 3.7
with a section allowing for backports to earlier versions by redistributors.
